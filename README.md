## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

![TODO: Update the path with the name of your diagram](Diagrams/RedTeam-Network-Diagram.png)

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the _____ file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

  - _TODO: Enter the playbook file._

This document contains the following details:

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available, in addition to restricting within to the network.
- Load balancers prevent direct access to webservers (RedTeam-DVWA1-vm , RedTeam-DVWA2-vm ), the webservers are configured with no public IP/access. Jump box(RedTeam-JumpBox-vm) is configured to deploy configurations to the   webservers using Ansible. Since the webservers running docker containers, it is fully managed via Jump Box using Ansible.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the logs and system metrics.
- Filebeats collect logs from servers operating system.
- Metricbeat collect metrics from server operting system.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the JumpBox(RedTeam-JumpBox-vm) machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- 40.114.90.44
- 52.149.218.207
- 13.91.21.207

Machines within the network can only be accessed by Load balancer.
- Jump Box(RedTeam-JumpBox-vm)40.114.90.44

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name               | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| RedTeam-JumpBox-vm | No                  | User IP              |
| RedTeam-lb         | Yes                 | Any                  |
| RedTeam-ELK-vm     | Yes                 | Any                  |
| RedTeam-DVWA1-vm   | No                  | 10.0.0.4             |
| RedTeam-DVWA2-vm   | No                  | 10.0.0.4             |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- ELK server can be managed remotely.
- Deployment is quick with easier maintainance.
- Deployments with virtually no downtime.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Install docker.io
- Install python3-pip
- Install docker python module
- Increase virtual memory 
- Download elk image
- Run elk image in a docker container.

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- 10.0.0.5
- 10.0.0.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- File Beats
- Metric Beats

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Filebeats collect logs from servers operating system.
- Metricbeat collect metrics from server operting system.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the filebeat-config.yml file to /etc/ansible/files/
- Update the filebeat-config.yml file to include ELK private IP
- Update filebeat-config.yml, metricbeat-config.yml, hosts. Use ansible hosts file to add hosts, elk host has been used to install ELK on ELK vm , webservers host   has been used to install filebeat on webservers.
- Run the playbook(filebeat-playbook.yml), and navigate to http://<ELK IP>:5601 to check that the installation worked as expected.
- http://[public IP of ELK vm]:5601
- Download filebeat-config.yml using curl           https://gist.githubusercontent.com/slape/5cc350109583af6cbe577bbcc0710c93/raw/eca603b72586fbe148c11f9c87bf96a63cb25760/Filebeat > /etc/ansible/files/filebeat-config.yml
